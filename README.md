# steps
1. update & configure your motherboard's bios 
	- attach a flash drive to your computer (preferably less than 32gb)
	- format your flash drive as fat32 ([tutorial](https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1044735/))
	- download the latest bios file from your motherboard's support page
	- copy the bios file to the flash drive
	- enter bios (mash [delete] key while computer is restarting)
 	- verify that cpu temp isn't anything crazy
  		- should be on bios home page
		- should be sub 60c
  		- if temps are higher than this you
			- mounted your cpu cooler incorrectly
			- didn't plug in your fans / fans are defective & not running
			- used an inadequate cpu cooler
			- have major airflow problems in your case
	- undergo the bios update process ([tutorial](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6ZAMrjRudg>))
	- enable x.m.p ([tutorial](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCnGQPlY6pE>) | should be similar for most motherboards)
	- set fan curves in bios if desired ([tutorial](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoWlNIzOO0E>) | different per motherboard)
3. purchase/obtain a `windows 11 pro for workstations` product key
	- buy keys [here](https://wholsalekeys.com/shop/windows-11-pro-for-workstations/)
 	- if you have a business grade microsoft account for work you may be able to obtain a key for free [here](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=Windows%2011)

15. verify that temperatures are in-check
	- open HWiNFO (installed via wigui, search start)
 		- select "show sensors" 
	- temps or model dependent
 	- higher end components run hotter than lower end components
  	- lower temp is better but as long as things are generally in below ranges you should be fine 
 		- cpu idle temp should be 30-50c 
  		- gpu idle temp should be 30-50c
16. download/install drivers from the **drivers** list below
